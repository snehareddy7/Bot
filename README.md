# Bot
I've written some code that acts as a bot. I used some print directives that let the user  know the bot's requirements. 
We  used a Python library such as speech recognition that allows users to interact with the bot  by voice. 
Prints the user's input by voice. To activate the bot, the user must say "Hello Alex", "Good morning Alex", and so on. I have named the bot ALEX.
